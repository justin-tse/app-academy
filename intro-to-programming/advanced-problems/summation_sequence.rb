# A number's summation is the sum of all positive numbers less than or equal to
# the number. For example: the summation of 3 is 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, the
# summation of 6 is 21 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. Write a method
# summation_sequence that takes in a two numbers: start and length. The method
# should return an array containing length total elements. The first number of
# the sequence should be the start number. At any point, to generate the next
# element of the sequence we take the summation of the previous element. You
# can assume that length is not zero.

def summation_sequence(start, length)
  array = [start]

  while array.length < length
    array << summation(array[-1])
  end

  array
end

def summation(num)
  sum = 0
  (1..num).each { |i| sum += i }
  sum
end

print summation_sequence(3, 4) # => [3, 6, 21, 231]
puts
print summation_sequence(5, 3) # => [5, 15, 120]
